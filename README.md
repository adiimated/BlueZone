# The Blue Zone Project

## Background
The desire to live a long and healthy life is universal. This project draws inspiration from "blue zones," areas identified by Dan Buettner and National Geographic where people live significantly longer and healthier lives. These regions include Sardinia (Italy), Okinawa (Japan), Loma Linda (California), Ikaria (Greece), and Nicoya (Costa Rica). The concept of blue zones offers insights into factors that contribute to longevity and reduced chronic illness.

## Problem
Despite high healthcare spending—averaging $13,493 per person and totaling $4.5 trillion annually—the U.S. healthcare system underperforms in various health metrics compared to other developed nations. The life expectancy in the U.S. has recently fallen below that of China, highlighting flaws in the American healthcare system. Furthermore, although the U.S. leads in cancer screenings and has seen a significant reduction in cancer deaths, the healthcare system is plagued with inconsistencies and inefficiencies, particularly in how it manages chronic conditions.

## Goal
This project aims to:
- Identify American counties with the highest number of centenarians and investigate the contributing factors to such longevity.
- Examine the impact of healthcare variables, environmental conditions, lifestyle choices, socioeconomic status, and demography on life expectancy**.
- Explore disparities between rural and urban areas in terms of healthcare and lifestyle factors.
- Evaluate variations in life expectancy among U.S. counties to provide a nuanced understanding of the local healthcare systems.

## Data Sources
This project will leverage various data sources including public health records, census data, environmental reports, and local government databases.
